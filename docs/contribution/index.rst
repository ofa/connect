Contributing to Connect
***********************

Connect is an open-source project released under the :doc:`MIT license <../license>` and pull requests and issues can be filed on the `Connect Github Repository`_.

Contribute Front-End Code
=========================


1) Install the needed dependencies by running, from the root directory:

`npm i`
`bower i`

Dev dependencies for Connect are managed by NPM, and front-end dependencies are managed by bower. These dependencies are required before compilation.

2) Review Connect's client-side code: The files are found in the top level folder `assets.` Javascript, JS templates, and LESS files are located here.

3) Compile the assets: From the root directory, run the command `grunt` -- this will pre-compile the Hogan templates, compile the LESS, minify the javascript, autoprefix the compiled CSS files, and copy the webfonts to the correct directory.

As a default, the Gruntfile is pointed at the default tasks configurations, location in `/open_connect/connect_core/`. Each task has its own file in a folder called `grunt`, and global variables for use in the tasks are defined in `grunt_config.json`.

As you make edits default client side assets, you can compile to see the changes.

**NOTE: This process is only for making open source constributions. Changing the default assets is not the recommended way of customizing/skinning Connect, as your changes would be overwritten as you upgrade versions. To customize Connect's styles, see instructions below.**

A `watch` task is provided in case you would like files to compile while you work.
